# Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)

A data-driven road safety project completed through the **National Student Data Corps** in collaboration with the **U.S. Department of Transportation**.

## Project Summary
-> Analyzed over 30,000 records of motor vehicle collision data from New York City.
-> Identified boroughs and time periods with the highest crash-related injuries and fatalities, and proposed strategies to support safer road infrastructure for vulnerable road users.
-> Used Python, R, and Power BI for time-series, geospatial, and severity-level analysis; created interactive dashboards and visuals that highlight safety hotspots and policy opportunities.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Google Colab)
- R & RMarkdown
- Power BI (.pbix)
- Excel (Pivot tables)
- GitHub (project sharing)

## Key Insights
-> Most severe crashes occur during morning and evening rush hours.
-> Brooklyn and Manhattan had the highest rates of pedestrian injuries.
-> Intersections with overlapping school/pedestrian zones showed repeated injury clusters.

## Visual Outputs
->  Geospatial injury heatmaps

->  Time-series charts by hour and day

->  Borough-level injury dashboards (Power BI)
