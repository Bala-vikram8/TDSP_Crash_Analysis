# 🚦 NYC Traffic Safety Analysis – TDSP Project

This project was completed under the **Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)** in collaboration with the **National Student Data Corps (NSDC)** and **U.S. Department of Transportation**.

## 🧠 Project Summary

**What I Did:**  
Analyzed NYC motor vehicle collision data across boroughs and years to identify high-risk zones and injury predictors.

**Impact Achieved:**  
Discovered borough-specific injury spikes (especially in the Bronx), temporal trends (e.g., evening rush hours), and actionable insights for city safety policy.

**How I Did It:**  
Applied Python, R, and Power BI for geospatial, time-series, and predictive modeling. Used Random Forest to rank variables and inform prescriptive strategies.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques
- Python (Jupyter, sklearn)
- R & RMarkdown
- Power BI (Interactive Dashboards)
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Time Series and Borough-Based Aggregations

## 📈 Key Findings
- Bronx is the highest risk borough for injuries
- Evening rush hours (3 PM–6 PM) show peak injury risk
- Fatalities are more likely from 2 AM–4 AM (potential DUI correlation)
- Motorist injuries dominate; pedestrian/cyclist risk varies by time
- Random Forest variable importance shifts by year — showing policy impact
